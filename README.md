Utilities to connect to Pixel Dice using Python.

This project makes use of [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy) lib as its bluetooth stack. See pixels.py to get started.

The advertisement data structure and the some messages have changed since this project was last updated.

For a more recent Python implementation, see AstraLuma's [Nat20](https://github.com/AstraLuma/nat20) package.
